                    <p class="fst-italic">Biofuel engineers are engineers that help us reduce our carbon footprint by finding uses for fuel that is made from plant sources. Biofuel engineers ensure that the biofuel is generated efficiently to be used for electricity, heating homes, and powering vehicles. They do this by designing devices, procedures, and processes.</p>
                    <h4>Career details:</h4>
                    <p>Like all engineering careers, biofuel engineers are problem solvers. They spend their day analyzing existing biofuel systems so that they can work on improving them or designing new ones. Leadership skills are very important for a person in this career because they may oversee other engineers involved in biofuel production.</p>
                    <p>What is biofuel energy?</p>
                    <P>This is a type of energy that is made from organic matter.</P>
